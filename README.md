#Sonar-Rock-VS-Mine-Detection-with-Python  
 This project is taken by the inspiration of submarines and ships accordingly to predict the mines underwater.  
 The flow of the project is as following:  
 1)Importing dependencies  
 2)Data collection and data preprocessing  
 3)Training and Test Data  
 4)Model Training  
 5)Model evaluation  
  a)Accuracy on training data  
  b)Accuracy on testing data  
 6)Making predictive system  
 Finally after completion of project the accuracy score on testing data i got is 76.1%  
 I used google collab for the project
